This repos is designed for CFD reference solution which can be generated by following methods:

1. Analitical solutions which is coded into c++ or MATLAB
2. Numerical solutions which is computed by low order method in highly refined meshes.

The folder is named as "Equation_dimension_description"

In each folders there are a README which will explain the setting of the problem and the detailed description of how to generated reference solution.
